1. When placed facing and perpendicular to a smooth surface such as a wall, what are the minimum
and maximum depths that the sensor can reliably measure?
Maximum: 198
Minimum: 1

2. Move the sonar so that it faces the wall at a non-orthogonal incidence angle. What is the maxi-
mum angular deviation from perpendicular to the wall at which it will still give sensible readings?
approximate +/-30 degrees

3. Do your sonar depth measurements have any systematic (non-zero mean) errors? To test this, set
up the sensor at a range of hand-measured depths (20cm, 40cm, 60cm, 80cm, 100cm) from a wall
and record depth readings. Are they consistently above or below what they should be?

distance    mean
10           13
20           23
40           40
60           60
80           81
100          100

The systematic errors tends to drop to zero with increasing distance.
The standard deviation is really close to zero because of consistent readings.


4. What is the the accuracy of the sonar sensor and does it depend on depth? At each of two chosen
hand-measured depths (40cm and 100cm), make 10 separate depth measurements (each time
picking up and replacing the sensor) and record the values. Do you observe the same level of
scatter in each case?

For 10 times:
distance    variance     standard deviation
40            0                     0
100           0                     0

Yes. There is the same level of scatter in each case. The sonar sensor is accurate enough to
have absolute zero variance and standard deviation.


5. In a range of general conditions for robot navigation, what fraction of the time do you think your
sonar gives garbage readings very far from ground truth?
The sonar absolutely has no garbage readings very far from the ground truth.
